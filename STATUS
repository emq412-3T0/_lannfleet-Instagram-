Status of 1.11.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1845212
   Silence a deprecation warning from amalgamated SQLite on macOS.
   Justification:
     Keeps the macOS warnings checker buildslave clean.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp

 * r1850651
   Fix a use-after-free in mod_dav_svn's logging of FS warnings.
   Justification:
     Lots of crashes on OpenBSD during 'make check' with HTTPD 2.4.
     See https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2018-12/0137.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane

 * r1851903
   Fix missing unlock of working copy in a resolver error case.
   Justification:
     Could force users to run 'svn cleanup' unnecessarily.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1851920
   Remove a useless common ancestor search from the conflict resolver.
   Justification:
     Current behaviour is inefficient and could lead to dubious conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1852013
   Fix issue #4804: avoid test failures just because some SQLite compile-time
   feature was enabled that changes its query plan descriptions.
   Justification:
     Reported build failure on Gentoo Linux, see:
     https://bugs.gentoo.org/605438
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp

 * r1852436
   Make 'svn update' not record a tree conflict when deleting an unmodified
   directory which happens to contain unversioned items.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary tree conflict due to e.g. build artifacts on disk.
     User complained: https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2019-01/0060.shtml
     IRC discussion:
     https://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/svn-dev?date=2019-01-29#l10
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1853450
   Enable 'incoming_move_file_merge' option only if local change is file edit.
   Justification:
     Conflict resolver misbehaves when it runs into move vs move conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1853483
   Fix #4760 "Missing children when svnadmin dump --include/exclude converts
   copy-dir to add-dir".
   Justification:
     The new-in-1.10 feature was broken.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stsp

 * r1854072, r1854074, r1854216
   Fix issue #4806: Remove on-disk trees with read-only directories in them.
   Justification:
     Fixes an edge case in our tree removal code. If we clear read-only
     permissions on files in order to remove them, we should do the same for
     directories.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp

 * r1855419
   Fix conflict resolver bug where local and incoming edits got swapped.
   Justification:
     Bug breaks text conflict resolution.
     User complained: https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2019-03/0012.shtml
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.11.x-r1855419
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1856397
   Allow generating Visual Studio 2019 projects
   Justification:
     Makes it easier to build Subversion on Windows. Simple local fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1857367
    Fix memory lifetime problem in a libsvn_wc error code path.
    Justification:
      Edge-case crash. Subversion should not crash.
    Votes:
      +1: stsp

 * r1857391
   Fix build with APR 1.7.0.
   Justification:
     Bogus configure script check relies on APR internals.
     See https://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2019-04/0041.shtml
     and https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2019-04/0020.shtml
