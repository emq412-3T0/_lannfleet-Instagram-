Candidate changes:
==================

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1859732, r1859734
   io: Implement the functions that check for node existence using the native
   Win32 APIs on Windows.
   Justification:
     - This allows us to remove the hack from r1833621 and properly handle
       reparse points on Windows irrespectively of the used APR version.
     - This improves the I/O performance by using only a single call to
       GetFileAttributes(), which is much faster than the generic stat
       implementations from APR 1.6.x and 1.7.x (the latter should be
       even more slower).

 * r1860936, r1860951, r1860958
   Provide a way for svnserve's 'get-deleted-rev' API to return 'not deleted'.
   Justification:
     Error handling was inconsistent across RA layers.
