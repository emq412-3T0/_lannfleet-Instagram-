Status of 1.12.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1860175,r1860186,r1860187,r1860188
   Fix building Subversion with Visual Studio 2005 and 2008.
   Justification:
     A change in 1.12 accidentally introduced a macro escaping issue
     which broke compilation with these older versions of VC++.
   Notes:
     Should have been a simple patch. But lack of this version on my
     development machine made things harder.
     (I don't see a problem with dropping VS200 2008 support with
      a future Subversion version, but then we should provide better
      documentation on that change.)

 * r1859732, r1859734
   io: Implement the functions that check for node existence using the native
   Win32 APIs on Windows.
   Justification:
     - This allows us to remove the hack from r1833621 and properly handle
       reparse points on Windows irrespectively of the used APR version.
     - This improves the I/O performance by using only a single call to
       GetFileAttributes(), which is much faster than the generic stat
       implementations from APR 1.6.x and 1.7.x (the latter should be
       even more slower).

 * r1860936, r1860951, r1860958
   Provide a way for svnserve's 'get-deleted-rev' API to return 'not deleted'.
   Justification:
     Error handling was inconsistent across RA layers.
